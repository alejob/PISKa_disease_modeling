There are many files needed to run the simulations, they are:

model-gamma.cka:     	    Main file, include the model
ebola-all_obs.cka: 	    Here we define the variables (agents) of the system
ebola-init-CL-info-4.cka:   Parameters of the country: Population, ratios between cities, link and transport. 
ebola-info_pert_fast.cka:   Perturbation of the system, initial and final time
parameters.cka:		    Parameters given to a precompiled simulation (.bout)
