There are many files needed to run the simulations, they are:

model-gamma.cka:     	    Main file, include the model
observables.cka: 	    Here we define the variables (agents) of the system
CL-4cities.cka:   	    Parameters of the country: Population, ratios between cities, link and transport. 
perturbation.cka:   	    Perturbation of the system, initial and final time
parameters.cka:		    Parameters given to a precompiled simulation (.bout)
